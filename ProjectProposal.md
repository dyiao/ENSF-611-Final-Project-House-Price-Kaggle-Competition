# Project proposal for Kaggle Competition - House Prices
Author: *Deylin Yiao*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
I want to learn the procedure and participating a Kaggle competition, with the plan to implement
XGBRegressor (using supervised ML Regression method as this competition has a target vector with continuous values).
The Kaggle competition involves determining house prices based off of 79 different features provided.
## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
I have created a Kaggle account and decided to participate in an introductory competition. I will follow the guidelines
set by the competition, while also documenting the process through a jupyter notebook. I will use Lab 2 as a template
as it covers supervised learning regression.
Feature engineering will be key in conditioning the provided dataset, as most of the
dataset are not continuous value, but rather a range of discrete words to describe the features.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
